# Gavio Arquitetura

üè¢ **Project Overview**

Gavio Arquitetura is my first personal project, completed in April 2021. It is a website developed for an architecture group, serving as a portfolio where users can showcase their architectural projects. The project presented a significant challenge as it was developed entirely on my own, relying on self-learning and exploration.

## Technologies Used

üöÄ The Gavio Arquitetura project was built using the following technologies:

- **PHP:** The primary language used for server-side scripting and developing the website's functionality.
- **Javascript:** Used to add interactivity and enhance the user experience on the client side.
- **Laravel:** A powerful PHP framework that provides a robust and scalable architecture for building web applications.
- **Eloquent ORM:** A database abstraction layer in Laravel, enabling seamless communication with the MySQL database.
- **MySQL Database:** The chosen database management system to store and retrieve data efficiently.
- **Bootstrap:** A popular CSS framework used to create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.

## Prerequisites

To run the Gavio Arquitetura project, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- PHP is installed on your machine, with its extensions enabled, or you have a containerized environment set up.
- Dependencies should be installed using Composer.

## Features

üí° The Gavio Arquitetura project offers the following features:

- **Portfolio Display:** Users can showcase their architectural projects on the website.
- **Admin Area:** Users have access to an admin area where they can edit their profiles, manage and update their projects, as well as add and delete projects.
- **Contact Form:** The website provides a contact form that allows users to send emails to the administrator for inquiries and requests.

That's it! The Gavio Arquitetura project represents a significant milestone as my first personal project, where I embraced the challenge of being self-taught and explored various technologies and frameworks to create a fully functional architecture portfolio website.
